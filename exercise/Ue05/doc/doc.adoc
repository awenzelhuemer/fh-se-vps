== Stock Data Visualization

Async implementation of the stock visualization.
The version with the async and await keywords is much shorter than the other one.

.Wrapped methods

----

=== Version with .NET Task Parallel Library

.Version 1
[source,csharp]
----
include::{src}/Quandl/Quandl.UI/QuandlViewer.cs[lines=101..122]

=== Version with async and await

== Parallel Wator

=== Idea and implementation

The simulation can be parallelized by creating parts which get calculated simultaneously.
The height of the section has to be at least 4 otherwise there would be race conditions.

.Splitting into Partitions
image::{img}/Distance.png[pdfwidth=50%]

The separation is done with the help of a partitioner.
It is important that the count of the partitions is even because otherwise there would be race conditions with the first and the last rows.


.Partitions
[source,csharp]
----
include::{src}/WatorWorld/Wator/Async/AsyncWatorWorld.cs[lines=53..64]
----

<<<
The random matrix gets not randomized in the constructor anymore because only parts get randomized not everything.

.Matrix initialization
[source,csharp]
----
include::{src}/WatorWorld/Wator/Async/AsyncWatorWorld.cs[lines=66..67]
----

First, all even partitions get executed.
After the execution the uneven partitions get executed and the commit gets called.
The method itself gets called in `ExecuteStep()` with `Task.Run(ExecuteStepAsync).Wait()`.

.Step execution
[source,csharp]
----
include::{src}/WatorWorld/Wator/Async/AsyncWatorWorld.cs[lines=128..161]
----

The execution of the partition is similar to the previous algorithm.
The difference is that randomize matrix gets called for each partition and a lower and upper height limit is needed.

.Partition execution
[source,csharp]
----
include::{src}/WatorWorld/Wator/Async/AsyncWatorWorld.cs[lines=102..126]
----

The matrix randomization method got two parameters for the lower and upper height limit because only the part should gets shuffled.

Advantages:

- Nearly twice as fast than the previous version
- Easy implementation and not much to change

Disadvantages:

- No complete randomness because only parts get randomized

This version is nearly twice as fast than the last optimized.
