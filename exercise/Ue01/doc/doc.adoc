== Setup

----
Number of cores: 4
Memory size 16,0 GB
CPU type: Intel Core i7-8565U 1.80GHz
System: Windows 11
----

== Theory

=== Calculate and plot speedup and efficiency

Speedup = 1 / (σ + (1 - σ) / Cores) +
Efficiency = Speedup / Cores +

Seq: 0.2 +
Par: 0.8 +
Cores: n

image::{img}/1_1.png[]

The limit for speed up is 5.

=== Calculate and plot σ with increasing problem sizes

image::{img}/1_2.png[]

With a problem size of 10000 the sequential part gets extremely small.

=== How many processors can be utilized?

p = 100: 11 cores are needed +
p = 1000: 100 cores are necessary +
p = 10000: With 1000 cores an efficiency of 80% can be reached +

== Wator

=== Review of the application

==== Design
The methods are too long and could often be simplified. Also some methods could be created in separate classes instead they are all in OriginalWatorWorld.

==== Efficiency
The program in case of efficiency has definitely potential for improvement. For example the use of two dimensional arrays or the creation of an position array each time the GetNeighbors function is called is not ideal. Also the shuffle method is not very well implemented.

==== Clarity
With the GetNeighbors function, the if else constructs are not very ideal to read and could be improved or separate methods could be created.

==== Readability

Readability is definitely not the best. For example the GetNeighbours function is too long with lots of code duplications.

=== Three improvements

==== Improvement 1

Changed point array of GetNeighbours to List.
Also introduced it globally to reduce the work of the garbage collector.
Otherwise each time a new array has to be created.
The list gets reused every time.

public IList<Point> GetNeighbours(Type type, Point position)
{
    points.Clear();
    int i, j;

    // look north
    i = position.X;
    j = (position.Y + Height - 1) % Height;
    if (type == null && Grid[i, j] == null)
    {
        points.Add(new Point(i, j));
    }
    else if (type != null && type.IsInstanceOfType(Grid[i, j]))
    {
        if (Grid[i, j] != null && !Grid[i, j].Moved)
        {  // ignore animals moved in the current iteration
            points.Add(new Point(i, j));
        }
    }
    // ...
} 
----

==== Improvement 2

Changed all two dimensional matrices do one dimensional.
That means that the animal board and the the matrix for the random positioning are only simple arrays where the index get calculated with a special function.
Improvements can be seen especially on the ExecuteStep and RandomizeMatrix functions.

==== Improvement 3

Used more performant version of the Knuth Shuffle.
Also improved memory consumption of sharks by removing the second division.
