== Theory

=== Calculate and plot speedup and efficiency

Speedup = 1 / (σ + (1 - σ) / Cores) +
Efficiency = Speedup / Cores +

Seq: 0.2 +
Par: 0.8 +
Cores: n

The limit for speed up is 5.

=== Calculate and plot σ with increasing problem sizes

With a problem size of 10000 the sequential part gets extremely small.

=== How many processors can be utilized?

p = 100: 11 cores are needed +
p = 1000: 100 cores are necessary +
p = 10000: With 1000 cores an efficiency of 80% can be reached +
