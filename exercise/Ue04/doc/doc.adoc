=== Simulation Logic

.SequentialImageGenerator.cs
[source, csharp]
----
include::{src}/Diffusions/Generators/SequentialImageGenerator.cs[]
----

=== Background Computing

When the method `Start` gets called, a new `Task` gets started.
Additionally an `CancellationTokenSource` gets created.
When `Stop` gets called, `cancellationTokenSource.Cancel()` gets executed.
The loop where the iterations are running, gets canceled and the simulation stops. 

.ImageGenerator.cs
[source, csharp]
----
include::{src}/Diffusions/Generators/ImageGenerator.cs[]
----

=== Parallel Version

Fore the parallel execution, `Parallel.forEach` gets used instead of a normal loop.
The calculation gets splitted into tiny parts of work.
For the separation into separate parts, a `Partitioner` gets used which splits the width for the calculation.

.ParallelImageGenerator.cs
[source, csharp]
----
include::{src}/Diffusions/Generators/ParallelImageGenerator.cs[]

.Parallel result

.Sequential result

==== Speedup

Speedup = 2,9134082 / 2,334388 = 1,24804

The parallel version is 24,804 percent faster than the sequential one.

== Parallel Numerical Integration

=== C++ OpenMP

.ParallelImageGenerator.cs
[source, cpp]
----
include::{src}/Integrate/Integrate.cpp[lines=20..29]
----

=== C# .NET Task Parallel Library

The calculation gets separated into steps with the `Partitioner`, similar to the the OpenMP solution.
Additionally `Parallel.ForEach` gets called, the initial state gets set to zero.
For the second part all partitioned parts gets calculated separately.
The result gets added to the total result.
To prevent race conditions, an lock object is needed when a part sum gets added to the total sum.

.Program.cs
[source, cpp]
----
include::{src}/IntegrateCSharp/Program.cs[lines=28..55]
----

Both sequential and parallel versions of the C# implementation are slower than the C++ version.
With low step size the sequential version are much faster.
There is obviously more overhead with the .NET Parallel task library and the C# version.
Although with higher results the time for the parallel execution is nearly the same.
