== Simple Mandelbrot generator

Mandelbrot generation was already finished in the lesson.
This is the code for the synchronous image generation.

== Worker thread

=== Solution with thread

One possible solution would be to create each time a new thread which starts the image execution. If the method is currently executing an image generation, the previous generation gets cancelled via `CancellationTokenSource`. Additionally if the image was generated successfully, an event gets fired where the new image, area and time gets passed with `EventArgs`.

=== Solution with background worker

BackgroundWorker is used for image generation.
Previous worker gets cancelled if new worker gets created and started.
Two callback methods are used: `DoWork` and `RunWorkerCompleted`.
Additionally the flag `WorkerSupportsCancellation` has to be set.

== Parallelize work

The whole areal gets separated into multiple columns (depending on the worker count setting).
Each part gets calculated separately.
That means that for each each part an separate thread gets created.
After the generation of each part they get merged into one bitmap.

== Runtime measurement

The performance of the parallel generator is better than the synchronized one, already with 4 workers.
It looks like there is some overhead with the image merging and creating of multiple threads and the calculation for each part.
When the number of workers is changed to 8, the generation gets drastically faster.
The standard deviation gets also smaller with the parallel execution with 4 workers and even smaller with eight workers.
